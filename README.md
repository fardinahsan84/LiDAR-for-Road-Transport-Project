Vehicle Detection using LiDAR Technology for Pedestrians
This project focused on leveraging LiDAR (Light Detection and Ranging) technology for accurate and efficient vehicle detection in various environments for pedestrians before crossing the road.
•	Developed a flow chart for project demonstration.
•	Contributed on the coding part, fetched data from LiDAR sensors.
•	Fused LiDAR data with other sensors (e.g., cameras, radar) to improve detection accuracy and robustness.
